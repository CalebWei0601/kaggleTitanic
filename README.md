This is my very first ML model as part of the kaggle beginner competition.

The link to the competition is here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

I compared and contrasted three models: RandomForest, Naive Bayes and Linear Discrimant Analysis and eventually chose the first.

The model had a training f1_score of 0.93 and a validation f1_score of 0.78, and the final test accuracy was 0.77.
